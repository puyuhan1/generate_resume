# generate_resume

how to run this: Option 1: To check, change, debug, or just test the code: First git clone this repository in your local machine. Open the terminal and run this:
cd generate_resume   

Then run:
python main.py

and you will see a small line of phrase asking for your information, and you could input a short paragraph of your own introduction and press ENTER.

Option 2: Want a real interactive interface to use our framework? Run like this: Still git clone this repository to your local machine. Then do: cd generate_resume

Then run:
streamlit run app.py

And you can choose to type in your email to receive updated information or just leave it blank. After you press ENTER, the interface will pop up!
